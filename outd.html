                       <h3>OUTDOOR RESTAURANT</h3>
                       <p>Outdoor Rest offers zoo diners something different – not just a plate of food, but a theatre of experience. Outdoor Rest celebrates the quintessential South African tradition of cooking on fire – and not just meat, but all types of ingredients cooked on coals – including fish, poultry, vegetables and breads. The wine list has been painstakingly put together – it features 100 of the best local and some international wines. Diners can expect a great night out, with delicious food and top-notch service – and one of the best views of the zoo's.</p>
