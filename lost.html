                       <h3>LOST FOREST</h3>
                       <p>The Lost Forest isn’t hard to find — it’s just hard to see. Tucked in among the trees and rocks at the top of the park are the Breathtaker Alpine Coaster, Treeline Trial Challenge Course, and Rugged Ascent Climbing Wall. In addition, the Lost Forest operates as a home base for fishing, hiking, and disc golf. The Lost Forest is open daily from June 21 through September 6, then weekends September 10 through October 3..</p>
