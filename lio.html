                            <h3>LION</h3>
							<p>Lions are large mammals of the family Lionidae and the order Proboscidea. Two 
							species are traditionally recognised, the African Lion (Loxodonta africana)
							and the Asian Lion (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that
							African bush Lions and African forest Lions are separate species 
							(L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Lions are scattered throughout
							 sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Lionidae is the only 
							 surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the
							 order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African
							  Lions are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of
							 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).</p>
							 <p>All Lions have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long
							 trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting
							water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve 
							as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Lions' large ear 
							flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry 
							their great weight. African Lions have larger ears and concave backs while 
						   Asian Lions have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
						   <p>Lions are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including
							savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
						   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
							<p>You will find the Lions at pen E22, right next to the northren frontier.</p>
